# TrafficCongestion

ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Light Control using YOLOv11
This project implements an intelligent traffic management system using YOLOv11 for real-time vehicle detection from top-view traffic images. The system analyzes traffic density from two opposing directions and dynamically adjusts traffic light timingsâ€”granting longer green lights to the side with heavier traffic. This adaptive approach helps alleviate congestion and improve traffic flow efficiency in urban areas.
